# Using and extending your generated project

Projects created with Windows Template Studio are intended as a starting point, and will require modification and extension before they're finished. This page explains common ways to extend what is generated for you.

## Understanding generated code from Windows Template Studio 
The final generated code is the result of a project configuration (project type and design pattern) and a multiple template choice (pages and features). There are a few concepts to understand before start working on the generated code.

- [Navigation between pages](navigation.md)

## Understanding concepts for Windows Template Studio

Windows Template Studio approaches UWP app creation using the following four attribute sets to decide how to best generate your app.  Below we will describe everything you can do.

### Project Types
**Project types** define the basic look and feel of your UWP app.

| Project type | Description |
|-------------:|:------------|
| Blank | This basic project is a blank canvas upon which to build your app. It provides no scaffolding and leaves everything up to you. |
| [Navigation Pane](projectTypes/navigationpane.md) | This project includes a navigation pane (or 'hamburger menu') at the side of the screen to enable easy user navigation between pages. This style is popular in mobile apps, but also works well on larger screens. The menu can be hidden when space is limited, or when it isn't needed.|
| Horizontal Navigation Pane | Navigation Items across the top allow for quickly navigating between pages. This is recommended if you have 5 or fewer top level navigation items. The user can navigate between pages by selecting from the text headers, which are always displayed.|
| [Menu Bar](projectTypes/menubar.md) | This project contains a top menu bar with File and Views options and a Blank canvas to show your views. The project includes navigation methods to show views in different ways. |

### Design patterns

**App Design patterns** define the coding pattern that will be used across the project, tying your UI and code together. Windows Template Studio currently supports the three most common patterns:

| Design pattern| Description |
|--------------:|:------------|
| Code Behind   | Code is coupled directly with a XAML file using a .xaml.cs extension. If you developed in WinForms and feel comfortable with that style of development, this is a great option for you. |
| MVVM Basic    | [MVVM Basic](./mvvmbasic.md) includes the minimum necessary to follow the MVVM pattern without including any extra libraries or dependencies. It is intended for people new to MVVM or who are unable to or do not wish to use a 3rd party framework. |
| MVVMLight     | The [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://www.mvvmlight.net/) is a popular, 3rd party toolkit by Laurent Bugnion, which has the purpose of accelerating the creation and development of MVVM applications.  This toolkit puts a special emphasis on the "blend ability" of the created application (the ability to open and edit the user interface into Blend), including the creation of design-time data to enable Blend users to "see something" when they work with data controls.<br />As a toolkit, it provides a number of tools and features but there is no requirement to use all of them. This toolkit is popular with developers who want use parts of it to take care of the basics but still allow them to structure the code in their own way. |
| Caliburn.Micro| [Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) is a small, yet powerful framework, designed for building applications across all XAML platforms. Its strong support for MV* patterns will enable you to build your solution quickly, without the need to sacrifice code quality or testability.<br />It uses a convention based approach to mapping actions/events, bindings, and views to view models. While this framework is highly opinionated about how it should be used and apps should be constructed, it does allow for customization of it's behavior.<br />WTS only supports the use of Caliburn.Micro with projects created in C#. |
| Prism         | [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications. It was originally based on guidance from Microsoft's Patterns and Practices team but is now supported by an open source community. It is designed to help build rich client applications that are flexible and easy to maintain by composing different modules and following design patterns.<br />WTS only supports the use of Prism with projects created in C#. |

### Pages

| Page        | Description |
|------------:|:------------|
| Blank       | This is the most basic page.  A blank canvas to mold into whatever you wish.  The blank page leaves pretty much everything up to you. |
| Settings | The settings page is the page where we recommend putting the configuration settings for your application such as setting a dark / light theme. This could also include any licenses, version number and your privacy terms.|
| Web View | The web view page embeds a view into your app that renders web content using the Microsoft Edge rendering engine. |
| Media Player | A page for displaying video. It includes the MediaPlayer and has the default Media Transport controls enabled.|
| Master/Detail | The master-detail page has a master pane and a details pane for content. When an item in the master list is selected, the details pane is updated. This pattern is frequently used for email and address books. |
| Telerik Data Grid | A page displaying a [RadDataGrid control](http://www.telerik.com/universal-windows-platform-ui/grid), powered by [Telerik UI for UWP](http://www.telerik.com/universal-windows-platform-ui) which is available both [commercially](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/universal-windows-platform) and [open source](https://github.com/telerik/UI-For-UWP). A native, rich and powerful rid with unmatched performance. The grid offers advanced UI virtualization, customizable columns, single and multi-column sorting, data editing, selection and filtering.|
| Chart | A page displaying a [RadChart control](http://www.telerik.com/universal-windows-platform-ui/chart), powered by [Telerik UI for UWP](http://www.telerik.com/universal-windows-platform-ui) which is available both [commercially](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/universal-windows-platform) and [open source](https://github.com/telerik/UI-For-UWP). RadChart control for Windows 10 apps features a rich set of chart series from Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Scatter and Polar charts to different financial series.|
| Tabbed | The tabbed page is used for navigating frequently accessed, distinct content categories. |
| Map | The map page is based around the Windows Map Control. Code includes adding a Map Icon and getting your location. |
| Camera | A page for capturing a photo from the camera. Includes handling previewing, mirroring, and orientation.|
| Image Gallery | A page displaying a image gallery and allows user to navigate between gallery and image detail.|
| Content Grid | A page that allows you to add custom content in a [GridView](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/adaptivegridview) which is responsive to the screen size change. |
